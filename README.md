- 👋 Hi, I’m @Justin-Ruhl
- 👀 I’m interested in IT Security. I have decided to learn how to do some basic Java coding to help add another powerful tool to the toolbox when trying to defend information systems. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Securtiy in the IT world and how to best defend against threats. I'm working on my CEH certification as well as Comptia's CySA+.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learing projects that can help me gain a deeper understanding of the world of Java and become a better coder.
- 📫 I can easily be reached at Justin.W.Ruhl@gmail.com if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions!
